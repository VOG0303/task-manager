# Task Manager

This is a beginner-friendly Task Manager web app built as part of my Summer of Making project.  
The goal of this project is to learn **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** by building a functional task management app step by step.

## Current Progress

- Created a page with a **title**: "Task Manager"

## Goals

- Make the Add button **actually add tasks** using JavaScript
- Add the ability to **mark tasks complete** and **delete tasks**
- Apply **CSS styling** to improve the design
- Learn **front-end development practices step by step**
